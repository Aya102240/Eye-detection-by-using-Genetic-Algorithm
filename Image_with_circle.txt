
Function (Canny_edge_original_img):
get the edges of the original image 

Function (desired_output):
multiply the edges of unknown circle image and original image and get the first index length

Function (unknowncircle):
create image with every itration from the genetic algorithm 
That function return the edges that we get from multipling the edges of new circle image and original image and get the first index length

Function (draw_circle):
after detect the best circle ..... this function draw the circle on the original image on only one eye

Function (second_circle):
this function take the radius from the previous function and draw it on the second eye and show the original image with the two circles
